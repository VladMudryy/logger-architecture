# Error Logging Service Architecture

## Overview

An error logging service captures and records application errors, provides real-time alerts, and offers a dashboard for analysis.

## Architecture Breakdown

### 1. Client SDK

**Technology:** JavaScript / TypeScript with React and React Native

**Justification:**

* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** React Native allows developers to create one unified codebase for Android, iOS, and web applications.
* **Web Integration:** React seamlessly integrates with modern web frameworks, simplifying implementation across various projects.
* **Backend Compatibility:** JavaScript and TypeScript SDKs integrate easily with Node.js backend services, maintaining consistency throughout the stack.
* **Unified Codebase:** Simplifies ongoing maintenance, reduces complexity, and accelerates feature rollout and updates.
* **Robustness & Maintainability:** TypeScript enhances reliability through strong typing and improved error detection at compile time.

### 2. API Backend

**Technology:** Node.js with NestJS framework

**Justification:**

* Modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture.
* Handles high volumes of real-time error logs efficiently.
* Extensive middleware support for authentication, rate limiting, and validation.

### 3. Database

**Primary Storage:** PostgreSQL
**Secondary Storage:** Elasticsearch

**Justification:**

* PostgreSQL ensures reliable, structured management of user data, settings, and metadata.
* Elasticsearch provides high-performance indexing and querying for log data.
* ILM (Index Lifecycle Management) automates archival, retention, and deletion.

### 4. Web Dashboard

**Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS

**Justification:**

* React delivers efficient rendering for interactive dashboards.
* TypeScript and Redux Toolkit improve maintainability.
* Tailwind CSS ensures consistent, rapid UI styling.

### 5. Real-time Alerts

**Technologies:** WebSocket via Socket.io, Email notifications via SendGrid or AWS SES

**Justification:**

* Socket.io ensures instant communication between backend and frontend.
* SendGrid and AWS SES deliver reliable, scalable email notifications.

**Maintenance Costs:**

* **SendGrid:** \~\$19.95/month for 50,000 emails. Easy setup, high deliverability.
* **AWS SES:** \~\$0.10 per 1,000 emails. Cost-effective at scale, more setup required.

> **Recommendation:** SendGrid for ease, AWS SES for cost-efficiency at scale.

### 6. DevOps & Infrastructure

**Cloud Provider:** AWS
**Containerization:** Docker
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS)
**Monitoring & Alerting:** Prometheus & Grafana
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD

**Justification:**

* AWS offers scalable, secure cloud services.
* Docker and Kubernetes streamline deployments and scaling.
* Prometheus & Grafana provide robust monitoring and analytics.
* CI/CD automates delivery and reduces errors.

## Key Decisions Explained

### Real-time Processing

* Node.js non-blocking architecture handles thousands of concurrent logs.
* Socket.io pushes alerts instantly, reducing detection-to-resolution time.
* Enables live log streaming during debugging or investigations.

### Log Retention Policies

* Elasticsearch ILM transitions logs through hot, warm, cold, and delete phases.
* Reduces storage costs and keeps performance high.
* Policies vary by customer tier (e.g., 90 days for premium, 30 for free).

### API Rate Limits

* Middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`) prevents abuse.
* Protects backend stability from spikes or DoS attacks.
* Tier-based limits: 1,000 logs/min (premium) vs. 200/min (free).

### Security Measures

* JWT for stateless authentication.
* HTTPS/TLS encryption.
* RBAC to control access.
* Regular audits, dependency scanning, and OWASP best practices.
* Data encryption at rest via DB-level encryption or AWS KMS.

### DevOps Processes

* Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.
* Kubernetes for deployment automation, scaling, and rollbacks.
* Prometheus collects metrics; Grafana visualizes trends and triggers alerts.
* Logs and metrics stored separately but accessible via a central dashboard.
* CI/CD pipelines run tests, build Docker images, and deploy automatically.

## Questions to Clarify Requirements

1. SDK Integration: Sensitive data handling?
2. Error Severity & Alerts: Definition of "critical" errors? Preferred channels?
3. Data Storage & Retention: Expected volumes? Retention duration? Compliance?
4. Dashboard Features: Key analytics? Role-based permissions?
5. Security & Compliance: Standards or certifications? Encryption requirements?
6. Performance: Response time benchmarks? Scalability targets?
7. DevOps: Preferred cloud provider? Infrastructure constraints?
